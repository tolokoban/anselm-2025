    intro1: `Mr. Anselm,

We didn't have time to train you properly before this mission.
However, our analyses show that you may not have the required intellectual level.`,
    intro2: `To remedy this, we have prepared some brain-building exercises for you.
The first is called the Towers of Hanoi.
Each tower is composed of a maximum of four discs. It is forbidden to place a disc on a smaller disc.`,
    intro3: `You start with a tower on the left space and you must rebuild the tower on the right space.
You can only move one disc at a time.

Good luck.`,
    victory: "Victory!",
    win: `You succeeded? That's quite surprising...

So you are ready to continue your mission, Mr. Anselm. But your training isn't over yet.`,
